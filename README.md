CUNY DATA 607 TIDYVERSE Collaborative project

Tidyverse CREATE Assignment - Atina Karim

In this assignment I looked at Water Quality Data from the City of Austin's online data portal:[https://data.austintexas.gov/Environment/Water-Quality-Sampling-Data/5tye-7ray](https://data.austintexas.gov/Environment/Water-Quality-Sampling-Data/5tye-7ray). The dataset contains the results of about a 1000 water quality tests performed on water bodies in Austin, in 2020.

I used tidyverse packages such as tidyr and dplyr to clean the dataset, and then visualized the data using ggplot2.
