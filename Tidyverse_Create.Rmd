#Relocate changes the order of the columns
#the first argument should be the data set, the 2nd is the column you want to move, the third is a how you want to move it.  For this, i chose .after, which will place it after the specific column chosen for this parameter.
new_df = relocate(df, pollster, .after = start_date)
new_df

#count counts observations by group
#the first argument should be the data set, the 2nd is the column you want to group by, and the third is if you want to sort or not.
count(new_df, population, sort=TRUE)
```

# Create a scatter plot
#the first argument should be the data set, the 2nd is the x axis variable, and the third is the y axis variable.
ggplot(new_df, aes(x=population, y=sample_size)) + geom_bar(stat="identity")
